1. Importing Libraries
2. Importing dataset using url. ( dataset file is also present with the code)
3. Splitting the dataset into training set and test set. ( 80% trainset, 20% testset)
4. Fitting the Linear Regression model to training set.
5. Prediction the result on the Test set. ( Here the predection is only for one value as described in the task)
